# MyFirstWebsiteProphet
this is going to be my first run at creating a website that is behind my idea of prophet to spread the
gospel of Jesus Christ to as many people as I can with my new skill of front end development

Excellence in all things and all things glory to God!

I am going to impliment AI solutions to this development to help me save time
once this website is running, I am going to attempt to create an LLM that is based in the
truth of the Gospel to aggregate all of the great resources of the great pastors/preachers throughout history
The Lord also calls me to attempt to aggregate news - good and bad - and assign a Bible verse to how the gospel would apply to this sitution and how we really should respond to this. Whether that be in a bad situation where the the Gospel applies to a sinful situation and how the public needs to respond or a good situation where positivity is being spread and how the gospel shows us that the glory goes to God.
